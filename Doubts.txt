Doubts:-
1.As I am setting the position value to upper limit / lower limit if the value crosses the upper limit / lower limit, do we have to do the same for velocity as well, because velocity's value is impacting the position 


To do:-
1) Consider the solution generated from KNN as the best solution while initializing PSO
2) Fitness function will be implemented using KNN
3) Our goal is to find the maximum value of fitness function in PSO, not the minimal one
